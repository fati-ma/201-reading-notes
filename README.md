#### Hello, This is Fatima. Welcome to my website where I will share my notes from the reading assignments of Code 201. 😀
#### You can also view my website through this [link](https://fati-ma.github.io/201-reading-notes)


#### I would like first to share with you `one of my favorite quotes`: 

> Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean place, and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. ~~But it ain't about how hard you hit~~. ***It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!*** Now if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth, but you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!
